## Abstract
We implemented a self-supervised deep reinforcement learning algorithm on a simulated vehicle to learn a collision-free navigation policy. This algorithm is a generalized version of model-free and model-based learning that allows for a more robust system which uses aspects of both learning techniques. By using a list of generated actions and an image taken from a simulated camera on-board the vehicle, the probability of collision for each time step is generated and used to navigate through an unstructured environment. After implementing and testing the algorithm under different conditions, the model had difficulties learning and produced sub-optimal results. Some improvements for future work on the system were identified which are planned to be pursued by all group members.

## How to Run

1. Download CARLA Simulator from https://carla.org/ (The project was implemented using release 0.9.13 for Windows and 0.9.12 for Ubuntu)
    * Ensure CARLA Simulator Python API requirements are met in your environment (check \CARLA_0.9.XX\PythonAPI\carla\requirments.txt)
2. It is highly recommended that you execute the code using a GPU.  The code was setup for TensorFlow 2.3.1 so that the Numpy version requirements could be met for both the CARLA Simulator and TensorFlow
3. Ensure the project's dependencies are met using project_requirments.txt
4. Copy the PythonAPI and all subfolders into your project directory (in parallel with our code directory)
5. Launch the CARLA Server (rendering off screen is recommended) from your CARLA install
    * CarlaUE4.exe -RenderOffScreen for Windows
    * ./CarlaUE4.sh - RenderOffScreen for Ubuntu
6. Launch your virtual environment (if you're using one)
7. Configure the CARLA server to run Town02 map from the code subfolder in your project directory
    * python config.py -m Town02
8. Run our main code:
    * python Rl_Project_main.py
